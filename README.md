Introduction
The Face Attendance System is designed to streamline the attendance tracking process using facial recognition. Traditional methods of attendance can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This project solves these issues by automating the attendance process, eliminating the need for manual entry and reducing the chances of impersonation.

Features
Face Detection: The system detects faces in images using advanced computer vision techniques.
Face Recognition: It recognizes faces by comparing them to pre-trained images in the system.
Attendance Management: Automates the attendance marking process and maintains records.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
Flexibility: Can be used in various settings such as classrooms, meetings, and events.
Accuracy: Utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms to ensure accurate face recognition.
Logging: Keeps a log of attendance records for future reference.
